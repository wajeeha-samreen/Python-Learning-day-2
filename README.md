## Lists

A list is a dynamic, ordered collection of elements in Python. Lists are mutable, allowing for the addition, removal, or modification of elements after the list is created. They are created using square brackets, like `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`.

## Sets

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements in Python. Sets are useful for tasks that involve testing membership and eliminating duplicate entries. They are created using curly braces or the `set()` constructor, like `my_set = {1, 2, 3}` or `my_set = set([1, 2, 3])`.

## Dictionaries

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs in Python. Dictionaries are useful for storing and retrieving data with a unique key. They are created using curly braces, with each key-value pair separated by a colon, like `my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}`.

## Tuples

A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements in Python. Tuples are similar to lists, but once created, their elements cannot be changed. They are created using parentheses, like `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`.

## Arrays (NumPy)

While lists are versatile, NumPy arrays are used for numerical computations and data manipulation. Arrays in NumPy are homogeneous and support a variety of mathematical operations. They are created using the NumPy library, e.g., `import numpy as np; my_array = np.array([1, 2, 3])`.

Feel free to explore the examples and code snippets in each section to better understand and use these data structures in your Python Learning.

Happy coding!
